		<h2>What is Random Onion Links About?</h2>
		Random Onion Links is a website designed by me ofc, It is a site to explore the dark web but with a little twist!Every link on this site is random so you dont know what you are clicking,where are you going or what part of the internet you are going!The whole point of this site is to have fun while exploring these parts of the internet!
		<br><br>
		I know,I know it is not such a good idea clicking on random links especially when you are exploring the Dark Web.But trust me there are no bad links on this website,well there are a lot of websites that are drug or gun related but there are no Erotic,Child Porn or Red Room sites!Come on im not that sick. 
		<br><br>
		This site was only created for fun.Because i love programming so why not?Anyway exploring the Dark Web is not that scary how people think it is.Sure a lot of you are paranoid going there like ooh someone is gonna hack me!No you dont have to worry about that!If you know what you are doing then you dont have to worry about anything!
		<br><br>
		I too was Paranoid and scared going on the Dark Web.But then after countless of times going there it became boring.Half of the sites were shut down by the FBI,and Anonymous anyway.But before you go there,I recommend educating yourself on the does and donts on the Dark Web it is for the best.There is already a tutorial on how to stay Anonymous on the Dark Web on this site so go read it!
		<br><br>
		It is how i stay safe on the Dark Web and hope it helps!For the people who think that the Dark Web is really scary,its not!As I mentioned above most of the sites are dead.Of course there still is sick sites but you have to dig and dig and dig to find those sites.Or if your stupid enough to click on a free money add...I mostly use it to download music,movies and books that are not available on the surface web.so that is the quick summary of this site.Good luck exploring and have fun!
