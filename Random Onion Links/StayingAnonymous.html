<br><p style="color:white">So i made this tutorial on how to stay safe on the Dark Web, hope it helps!Ok lets get right into it!</p>
<br>
<h2 style="color:yellow">Step 1: Dont Use Windows!</h2>
<p style="color:white">Windows is the most popular and most used OP in the world,but because of its popularity,support in most software it is the easiest OP to get hacked!</p>
<p style="color:white">Hackers use it the most and know almost every leak in Windows,so for the best dont use any tipe of windows OP especially XP and 10!</p>
<p style="color:white">It is for the best to use Linux,you can use Mac aswell it is still more secure then Windows,But it is recommended to use Linux because it is the least popular OP in the world and has a strong security! </p>
<p style="color:white">The easiest and secure Linux OP is Tails,Im not going to explain what Tails is you have it on their website and the download for the software <a href="https://tails.boum.org">here.</a></p>
<p style="color:white">Tails is the easiest to setup if you just wannna go straight ahead,But if you want extra security There is a Debian based Tails OP known as "Whonix"</p>
<p style="color:white">Whonix is a Debian Based OP wich separates the Workstation where you browse and the Gateway where you operate so if for exaple The Gateway gets infected with a virus the Worstation will stay.</p>
<p style="color:white">Givin you enough time to sort things out!If you are going with Tails you can run it as a Live OS on a USB or on a VM(Virtual Machine).In my opinion running it on VM is the easier choice,And it gives you more freedom of controll!</p>
<p style="color:white">But if you are using Whonix you can only run it on a VM!For the Virtual Machine you have<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org">Virtual Box</a> or <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html">VMware</a></p>
<br>
<h3 style="color:yellow">Step 2: Pre Configure your Tor settings!</h3>
<p style="color:white">Of course you need Tor to access the Dark Web,well there are other ways to enter the Dark web but we are not going to go into that,this is about Tor!</p>
<p style="color:white">So of course when you enter Tor you are on the main page so the first thing you must do is click on the little onion in the top left corner and put the security level up to high!</p>
<p style="color:white">This will disable scripts whitch are used to track you!So crack the security levels up to high!! Next click on the three lines displayed in the top right corner,go to options</p>
<p style="color:white">Then go to search and disable every search engine except duckduckgo(or duckduck go onion) because duckduck go doesnt track you!</p>
<p style="color:white">Then go to privacy and security and on the history part set Never Remember History!!!</p>
<p style="color:white">Block all cookies and site data from websites,and check Tracking Protections to Always</p>
<p style="color:white">Scroll down a little bit on Security and enable Block Dangerous And deceptive content,Dangerous downloads and that it warns you about unwanted and uncommon software!</p>
<p style="color:white">And Especially dont connect or register your Firefox Account or you personal account,Thats a giant Red Flag,STAY AWAY FROM IT!!!!</p>
<br>
<h4 style="color:yellow">Step 3: Turn off your Microphone and Webcam</h4>
<p style="color:white">On the Dark Web there are hundreds of sick people waiting for the next victim to fall for their trap.If your Webcam is on they can hack into it and spy on you without you knowing it!</p>
<p style="color:white">Same thing goes with a microphone,if the hacker hacks into it he can hear your voice without you knowing!
<p style="color:white">If you are on a Desktop,simply unplugg your Webcam and microphone!But the problem is laptop users cant do that</p>
<p style="color:white">For the laptop users either ducktape the webcam and the microphone or disable it manually,or do both!</p>
<p style="color:white">This step is very important because if you dont do it it will cost you Big Time!</p>
<br>
<h5 style="color:yellow">Step 4: Dont Buy,Sell or go to Chat Rooms,Forums</h5>
<p style="color:white">Buying or Selling things is very,very risky!Doesnt matter if you are selling legal or illegal stuff,You will end up on the FBI watch list no matter what!So pls for the love of God dont do that!</p>
<p style="color:white">Talking in chat rooms or posting on Forum Posts or Imageboards is a stupid act and it will lead you in to trouble!</p>
<p style="color:white">There are a lot of criminals,Pedos and sick people and if you say something that offends them then you are Dead Meat!</p>
<p style="color:white">I should not be even mentioning this step but why not.Im just warning people,because this is not a game this is real life!</p>
<br>
<h6 style="color:yellow">Step 5: Use a VPN!</h6>
<p style="color:white">A VPN is shortly described as a Virtual Private Network.It masks your IP Adress and one second you are for ex. from America and the next second you are from Japan!</p>
<p style="color:white">Depends of course what country you choose!But one problem, VPN services are locked behind a paywall</p>
<p style="color:white">There are VPN s that are free but have poor security,you can try to torrent or crack a VPN but good luck with that!</p>
<p style="color:white">There are good free VPNS that provide good security and Tracking protection here are 3:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.tunnelbear.com">TunnelBear</a>
<li><a href="https://windscribe.com">Windscribe</a>
<li><a href="https://protonvpn.com">ProtonVPN</a>
</ol>
<p style="color:white">And be aware that combining a VPN and a Virtual Machine OS will give you high security and a low chance to get hacked.</p>
